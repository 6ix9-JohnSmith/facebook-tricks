            <h2>HACKING TERMS </h2>
            <p> HACKING TERMS.
                There are some terms that hackers use which noobs are not familiar with,
                but here I‘ll be explaining it all here so that whenever a
                hacker mentions words like it won‘t sound strange to you so without wasting
                any time lets dive right into it. I‘ll be listing the common and complex hackers
                abbreviations below which are:
                 FULLZ
                 DOB
                 SSN
                 MMN
                 LOGS
                 MOVES
                 LOADING
                 CC
                 ETC...
                FULLZ: This term is very simple to understand
                it‘s just like citizens complete details
                including [name, date a birth, mother‘s maiden name driving licenses and more]
                a fullz can even contain the victims work history credit card and national id
                passport all this can be gotten from a spammer in which I‘ll be telling you who
                and what a spammer is or you can also contact me if you need one.

            <h1>HOW TO CARD HOTELS BY AUTHORIZATION FORM</h1>
            <P>
                HOW TO CARD HOTELS BY AUTHORIZATION FORM
                what is it all about? Download <a href="http://rghost.ru/6BsVFb7Jn"></a>
                and carefully look !!! The authorization form is a questionnaire in
                which all the data of the payer, the period of residence and the
                card data specified by this form, the Cardholder confirms his consent
                to withdraw funds. Then the hotel employee enters the bank card data
                into the POS terminal and makes the payment.

                HOTELS CARDING STEP BY STEP Go to <a href="http://www.booking.com/"></a> Choose a hotel,
                make a reservation on the one we will occupy.

                You can do without booking.com and immediately call to hotel.
                Call the hotel and appear as an agent request authorization form to pay for the reservation.
                An approximate dialogue looks like this: - Hi, I'm from travel agency "XXXXX" we want to book a room for
                our
                client.
                Is it possible to pay through the authorization form? - Yes of course - Very well, send the form to
                travel@xxxxx.com


                <link rel="stylesheet" href="   http://www.booking.com/">

                Fill in the authorization form: Credit Card Holder's
                Name we enter Cardholder or a fictitious name.
                Hotel Guest Name we enter the one whom we will occupy.
                Phones we specify Skype with an answering machine. We make scan, there is an important nuance,
                it is better to draw not in the form of scans, but in the form of photos in hand.
                We send all this to the email indicated in the form, they are often asked to be faxed,
                then you need to call and ask for the email address.

            <h1>Let's Talk About LINUX.</h1>
            <h2>Linux NOTE.</h2>
            <p>
                Large portions of GNU/Linux functionality are achieved using the terminal. Most distributions of Linux
                include
                terminal
                emulators that allow users to interact with a shell from their desktop environment. A shell is a
                commandline
                interpreter
                that executes user inputted commands. Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a common default shell among many
                Linux
                distributions
                and is the default shell for macOS.
                These shortcuts will work if you are using Bash with the emacs keys.
            <h1>Open terminal</h1>
            <h3>
                Open terminal

                cursor. Alt + F

                the end of the line, cut the entire line. Ctrl + K Cut the line from the current position to the end of
                the line, adding
                it to the clipboard. If you are at the beginning of the line, cut the entire line. Ctrl + W Delete the
                word before the
                cursor, adding it to the clipboard. Ctrl + Y Paste the last thing from the clipboard that you cut
                recently (undo the
                last delete at the current cursor position). Alt + T Swap the last two words before the cursor. Alt + L
                Make lowercase
                from cursor to end of word. Alt + U Make uppercase from cursor to end of word. Alt + C Capitalize to end
                of word

                if you’ve edited it. Ctrl + P Shows last executed command, i.e. walk back through the command history
                (Similar to up
                arrow). Ctrl + N Shows next executed command, i.e. walk forward through the command history (Similar to
                down arrow).

            </h4>
            <h2>Terminal control</h2>
            <h4>
                Terminal control
                Ctrl + L Clears the screen, similar to the clear command. Ctrl + S Stop all output to the screen. This
                is useful when
                running commands with lots of long output. But this doesn't stop the running command. Ctrl + Q Resume
                output to the

                process, which returns
                shell prompt. You can then use bg command allowing that process to run in the background. To again bring
                that process to
                foreground, use fg command. To view all background processes, use jobs command. Tab Auto-complete ﬁles
                and directory
                names. Tab Tab Shows all possibilities, when typed characters doesn't uniquely match to a ﬁle or
